Hello world repository for Git tutorial by D K Swami
This is my 3rd repository and by making this repository i aim to get decent knowledge of git and github.

If you want to get started with git go to w3schools for simplest guide.
https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp
There should be a README file always included in every Repository.
